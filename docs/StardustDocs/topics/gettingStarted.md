Kotlin DataFrame is a JVM Kotlin library for in-memory data manipulation.

## Installation
First, pick up the latest version of DataFrame [here](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlinx/dataframe).
* If you wish to play with data in interactive mode, setup [Kotlin Kernel for Jupyter](installation.md#jupyter-notebook) and run DataFrame there
* If you have some JVM project, just add a dependency on DataFrame like it's described on [Maven Central search](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlinx/dataframe) site

## Examples
Hope that this documentation will help you to implement all the things you want to do with your data. To get inspiration, take a look at [examples](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe/tree/master/examples) folder. [Puzzles](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe/blob/master/examples/jupyter-notebooks/puzzles/40%20puzzles.ipynb) will quickly familiarize you with the power of DataFrame, and other notebooks and projects will show you some applications of DataFrame in practical data analysis.

## Feedback and contrubuting
If you found a bug, or have an idea for a new feature, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe/issues/new) in DataFrame GitHub repository.

If you wish to contribute, you're welcome! Choose an issue you like, let us know that you're working on it, and prepare a [pull request](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe/pulls). We'll review and merge it if everything goes well.

You can also give us feedback or ask a question in [#datascience](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C4W52CFEZ) channel of a Kotlin Slack.
